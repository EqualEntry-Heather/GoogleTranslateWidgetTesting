Working with a client and hit some issues with thier use of Google Translate Widget
Found Issue https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/accessible/aq9VKcq9YVw logged back on June, 22 2016
origianl repro location was apparently impacted by a WordPress upgrade, secondary repro on http://www.csulb.edu/  appears to have been modified to work around Googles issues.

Creating this to test with the default code provided by Google via https://translate.google.com/manager/website/?hl=en
