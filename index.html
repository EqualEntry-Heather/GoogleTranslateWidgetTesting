<H1>Google Translated Widget Testing</h1>
<p>Working with a client and hit some accessibiliyt issues with their use of Google Translate Widget.</p>
<p>Found an <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/accessible/aq9VKcq9YVw" OLD related issue> logged back on June, 22 2016.</p>
<p>The origianl repro location was apparently impacted by a WordPress upgrade.  Secondary repro on
  <a href="http://www.csulb.edu/"> appears to have been modified to work around Googles issues.</p>
