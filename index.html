<H1>Google Translated Widget Testing</h1>
<p>Working with a client and hit some accessibiliyt issues with their use of Google Translate Widget.</p>
<p>Found an <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/accessible/aq9VKcq9YVw">OLD related issue,</a> logged back on June, 22 2016.</p>
<p>The origianl repro location was apparently impacted by a WordPress upgrade.
Secondary repro on <a href="http://www.csulb.edu/">csulb.edu</a> appears to have been modified to work around Googles issues.
Creating this to further that original discusion.
